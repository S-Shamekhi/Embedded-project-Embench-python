# libEDN Python Conversion

## Original
- Full Python translation of EDN benchmark from Embench.
- Simulates digital signal processing (DSP) tasks: vector multiply, dot product, FIR/IIR filtering, lattice synthesis, JPEG DCT, vocoder codebook search.
- Designed to stress CPU and memory like real embedded systems.
- Verification may fail in Python due to integer overflow differences from C.

## Simplified
- Focuses on core DSP concepts: vector multiply, dot product, FIR filter.
- Easy to understand and use for learning signal processing basics.
- Shows how input signals are transformed via simple arithmetic operations.
- Expected outputs are predictable and illustrate key DSP concepts.
